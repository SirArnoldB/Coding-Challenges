Let's say the string word is an occurrence of the string sequence if sequence contains word as a substring.

Let's say the string word is a k-occurrence of the string sequence if sequence contains word repeated k times as a substring. 
Note that if word is an occurrence of sequence, it is a 1-occurrence as well.

For example, if word = "ab" and sequence = "dabcacab", then word is a 1-occurrence of sequence but not a 2-occurrence, because sequence doesn't contain "abab" as a substring. 
On the other hand, the string "ca" is a 2-occurrence of sequence, since it contains "caca" as a substring.

Given a string sequence and an array of strings words, your task is to find the maximal value of k for each element, such that words[i] is a k-occurrence of sequence. 
Return the k-values as an array of integers of length words.length.

Example

For sequence = "ababcbabc" and words = ["ab", "babc", "bca"], the output should be maxKOccurrences(sequence, words) = [2, 2, 0].

words[0] = "ab" is a 2-occurrence of sequence, because sequence[0..4] = "abab";
words[0] = "ab" is not a 3-occurence of sequence, because there is no substring "ababab" in sequence;
words[1] = "babc" is a 2-occurrence of sequence, because sequence[1..8] = "babcbabc";
words[1] = "babc" is not a 3-occurence of sequence, because there is no substring "babcbabcbabc" in sequence;
words[2] = "bca" is a 0-occurrence of sequence, because there is no substring "bca" in sequence.
