"""
Given a string, write a function to check if it is a permutation of a palindrome. 
A palindrome is a word that is the same forwards and backwards. A permutation is a rearrangement of letters. 
The palindrome does not need to be limited to just dictionary words. You can ignore casing and non-letter characters.

# Example:
    # Input: Tact Coa
    # Output: True (permutations: "taco cat", "atco cta", etc)
